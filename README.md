# NASA-HACKATHON
A visual tool to better understand about the water across the entire earth system to help elementary, middle, or high school students better understand the complete path of water.
Here we created a website called “ AQUADUX “ which could be easy to learn that everything starts with water.
One of the greatest benefits of this website is that it can help to student accountability,Web-based learning promotes active and independent learning,The video instructions that are provided for audio and video learning can be rewound and seen and heard again and again if you do not happen to understand the topic first time around.
we have used HTML,CSS and web development languages for developing the website.
